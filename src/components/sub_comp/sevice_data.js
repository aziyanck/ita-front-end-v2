    desc: `The best security system is a combination of automation, control and monitoring. This includes alarm systems, security cameras and video surveillance; keyed, keypad & keyless door entry systems; CO2, smoke, water & fire sensors, remote viewing and controlling. The right system enhances the safety of the property, protects its occupants and belongings, and prevents, minimizes and reports crime, accidents or disasters to you and first-responders.

    title: "SMART LIGHTING",
    desc: `A properly designed lighting + control system simplifies your life and provides security for your entire family. Other benefits include energy savings, convenience and an entertaining, warm environment that you recreate every time you touch the controls.

Lighting is no longer just a utility for your home. It’s an aesthetic that creates an ideal movie-viewing experience for your family, provides an ambiance that is lively for a gathering of guests, adds cheer to your holiday season, and even sets the perfect mood for a date night.

It’s not a switch. It’s not a bulb. It’s about setting the perfect scene—every time.`,

    title: "VIDEO SURVEILLANCE",
    desc: `With high-definition surveillance cameras in and around your home, you can monitor activities real-time whether you’re in the house or halfway around the globe. Receive live video streams of entrances to see who’s at the door, interior areas, the perimeter, or even check on the kids playing in the pool all from the same touch screen that controls your home entertainment system or from your smart mobile device.

CCTV is not just a preventative system, it can also help bring criminals to justice.`,

    title: "INTRUDER ALARMS / BURGLAR ALARM",
    desc: `Intruder/ Burglar Alarms are effective enough in boosting home security systems. They help scare the burglars away in case they manage to break in and also deter them off a property. The presence of a burglar alarm can deter a burglar from entering a home.

In addition, if a burglar alarm was integrated with another home security system this could further reduce the risk of your home being robbed. They can also give the homeowners peace of mind knowing that their home and their possessions are safe and secure from home intruders.`,

    title: "SMART LOCK / VDP",
    desc: `Smart door lock is a great alternative to the traditional mechanical door lock. This type of door lock is increasingly popular for its outstanding features such as high security, ease of use, and high durability.

When using a smart door lock, you do not need to carry a key and are not afraid of losing or forgetting it. These locks use magnetic keys, fingerprints, PIN numbers, and other smart features to access.

Video door phones are generally used in many places such as people's homes, especially in high-rise housing and apartment buildings to guard residents and monitor outside activity to ensure safety.`,

    title: "FIRE DETECTOR",
    desc: `If you are considering a home fire alarm system, there are several good reasons to own one. This can save the life of anyone in the house at the time—particularly at night. Anyone who is sleeping may not be awakened in time if a fire starts.

The earlier a fire is detected, the faster firefighters can respond. This may help avoid major damages. Fire alarms provide detection and notification automatically—whether you are home or not.`,
